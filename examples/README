This folder contains the relevant examples for the NSDF file format
In all cases, we utilize the NSDF Python library.

1) poolroom.py
   is an case considering non-neuroscience data testing for the agnosticism and versatality in this format.
   considers the case of liesure center, with pool rooms, each having multiple pool tables.
   
   In this case there is no hierarchy, and we utilize /model/modeltree to represent the model information.

2) hodgkin_huxley.py 
   is the simplest possible case of HH models from Neuroscience simulations. Running this generates 2 files.

   We show how to store membrane potential obtained from the soma of a cell, also shows how to store data
   from the channels.

3) test_brain.py
   is the case where we show how to store spiking data obtain from Brian simulator. Requires Brian simulator.
   Generates 3 files. Code for storing the data using native h5py is also included.

   We store the spikes obtained, we also show different dialects in which it is possible to save this data.

4) traub2005.py - WARNING : Running this generates large files!
   is an example of complete data obtained from simulations. Generates 6 large files.

   We store, Vms, Ims, spikes, etc. We also test different dialets possible with nonuniform and compressions.

5) model_description.py

6) external_model.py

5) neuron_Hay/test_neuron_Hay.py
   is the case of an actual simulation, this requires Neuron installed with python, generates 1 file.
   most of the program here is to obtain the currents from all the compartments.

   We show how to save the data from current injection, injection location, etc.

6) moose_Multi/multi1.py
   is the case from Moose demos, it generates 1 file. Requires MOOSE/asyn13  installed
   
   We show how to save multidimensional data (voxel, property, time) in uniform, while saving Ca dynamics

7) moose_NeuroML/granulecell_neuroml.py
   is the case to iillustrate the NeuroML fileinclusion inside NSDF. Requires MOOSE/asyn13 installed.
   This example is taken from Moose demos.

   This case is applicaple when user wishes to provide the code that generated the output.

8) datadump/test_parse_datadump.py and datadump/test_parse_datadump_spikes.py
   is the case when user wants to process existing data into NSDF. Requires pandas python package.
   This is partial data, and is only meant as illustrative of possible effecient operations.
